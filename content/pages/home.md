![Me]({filename}/images/headshot_small.jpg)

I am currently a PhD candidate at the [University of Maryland](http://www.umd.edu)
under [Professor S.K. Gupta](http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~skgupta), in the
Department of [Mechanical Engineering](http://www.enme.umd.edu).

My research is in the area of robotics, specifically in learning manipulation
behaviors. My goal is to build frameworks that will enable robots to learn new
tasks without explicit programming. In working towards this goal I am using
techniques from both autonomous learning, where the robot teaches itself
through experience, and imitation learning, where the robot can learn by
observing a human.
