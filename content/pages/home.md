![Me]({filename}/images/headshot_small.jpg)

I recently completed my PhD at the [University of Maryland](http://www.umd.edu) under
[Professor S.K.  Gupta](http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~skgupta), in the Department of [Mechanical
Engineering](http://www.enme.umd.edu), while also affiliated with the [Institute for Systems
Research](http://isr.umd.edu). I was a member of the [Maryland Robotics
Center](http://robotics.umd.edu) and worked with
[KUKA](https://www.kuka.com/en-us/products/robotics-systems/industrial-robots/lbr-iiwa) and
[Baxter](http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/baxter/) robots in the [Robotics Realization
Laboratory](http://rrl.umd.edu). Before my PhD, I worked at [Energetics Technology
Center](http://etcmd.com) developing planning, control, and simulation software for a
[Husky](https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/husky-unmanned-ground-vehicle-robot/) autonomous
ground vehicle platform.

My primary research area has been in robotic manipulation. Specifically, my dissertation was on
learning task models for handling nonrigid objects such as fluids and elastically deformable
parts. My overall career goal is to build frameworks and systems that will enable robots to learn
without explicit programming.  In working towards this goal I have made use of techniques from
both autonomous learning, where the robot teaches itself through experience, and imitation
learning, where the robot can learn by observing a human.

I am currently searching for professional opportunities in robotics, especially those related
to developing intelligent systems for industrial automation. I can be reached by email at
