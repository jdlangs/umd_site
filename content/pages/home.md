![Me]({filename}/images/headshot_small.jpg)

I am currently a PhD candidate at the [University of Maryland](http://www.umd.edu) under [Professor
S.K. Gupta](http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~skgupta), in the Department of [Mechanical
Engineering](http://www.enme.umd.edu), and am also affiliated with the [Institute for Systems
Research](http://isr.umd.edu). I am a member of the [Maryland Robotics
Center](http://robotics.umd.edu) and work with / help manage robots in the [Robotics Realization
Laboratory](http://rrl.umd.edu).

My research is in the area of robotic manipulation, specifically in learning task models for
handling nonrigid objects such as fluids and elastically deformable parts. My goal is to build
frameworks that will enable robots to learn new tasks without explicit programming. In working
towards this goal I am using techniques from both autonomous learning, where the robot teaches
itself through experience, and imitation learning, where the robot can learn by observing a human.
