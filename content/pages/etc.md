I am an active user and proponent of the
[Julia](http://julialang.org) programming language. Coming from a MATLAB
background originally, I think it is a superior open-source replacement that has
equally straightforward mathematical syntax, but much nicer language features
and much better performance.

As a [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org) user, I am eager to start introducing Julia into
the robotics community so I wrote the
[RobotOS.jl](https://github.com/phobon/RobotOS.jl) package to integrate the two.
