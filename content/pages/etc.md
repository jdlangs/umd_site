I am an active user and proponent of the [Julia](http://julialang.org) programming language. Coming
from a MATLAB background originally, I think it is a superior open-source replacement that has
equally straightforward mathematical syntax, but much nicer language features and much better
performance.

As a [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org) user, I am eager to start introducing Julia into the robotics
community so I wrote the [RobotOS.jl](https://github.com/phobon/RobotOS.jl) package to integrate the
two. The [BARC Project](http://www.barc-project.com) at UC Berkeley is a sample project where
researchers are using Julia [optimization tools](http://www.juliaopt.org) for robotics and using
RobotOS.jl to bridge between Julia and ROS.
